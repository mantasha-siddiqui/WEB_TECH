/*
*vh-viewport ht
*vw-viewport width
*the default font size of html tag is 16px
*there is one more property z-index which start from 0 suppose it is used when more
 then two box overlap each other so the box which has higher z-index it will be on first
 *z-index is the CSS property that controls the stacking order of overlapping elements on a page. 
 The property is called “z-index” because it sets the order of elements along the z-axis.



position property is used to positioning the element on webpage.
there are 5 position in css
1-static:-(initial position of element (starting position), we can't change the starting position it's fixed always start from left side)
2-relative:- it will take the reference of current position, we can change its position by giving properties (top left right bottom)
3-absolute:- it will take the reference of its nearest parent element suppose there is one container and inside that there is one element
 so to move the position of element it will take the referene of container.** but parent should be postion:relative , 
  if no parent is relatove it will take reference from body tag
4-fixed:- it is positioned relative to the  viewport it can be used for chatbox it position remain fixed
5-sticky:- it will stick to a particular position. it is scrollable upto a certain point but after 
it reaches that  point it get fixed like variour site navigation bars are there (we can fix the position at any side)
